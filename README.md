## Trending News Insights : Sentiment Analysis and News Bias Detection

This project focuses on using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to detect and analyze bias in news articles. The approach includes preprocessing text data, applying sentiment analysis, and utilizing machine learning models to classify news articles by their bias.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, tokenizing, lemmatizing, and removing stop words from text data.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Using VADER to assign sentiment scores (positive, negative, neutral) to news articles.
- **Machine Learning Models:** 
  - **Model 1:** TF-IDF vectorization with logistic regression.
  - **Model 2:** Combines TF-IDF vectorization with sentiment scores for enhanced classification.
- **Evaluation:** Accuracy and classification reports for both models on test datasets.

### Future Work:
- Experimenting with different machine learning models and feature engineering techniques.
- Exploring additional techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) and stylometry for a more comprehensive bias detection.

This project provides a foundation for understanding and detecting bias in news articles using NLP and machine learning.
